This will help us have a better view of the data and be sure of its organization, according to our objectives in this analysis.\n\nOrganization of Data\nThe data is in a long format, where each row represents one time point for every user. Every user gets a unique ID, and the data is tracked for the most part by time and date.\n\nData ROCCC (relevance, originality, completeness, consistency, and credibility)\nThis data is only up to 31 days and from only 30 users without demographic information; hence, it is not entirely reliable, nor does it represent the larger population. Besides, time being too small, one month, handicaps us in locating longer-term trends.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 3rd Phrase:

wellness, and improvement in sleep efficiency can directly reflect on general well-being.\nCalories and Steps: These metrics are valued because they have a deep connection with activity and fitness goals in mind; thus, helping users optimize daily routines.\nActivity and Sleep: There is a relationship between calories burned and sleep efficiency, which makes active users sleep better and can therefore serve as a powerful insight to be used in the marketing of sleep-related products.\n\nRecommendations for Bellabeat\n\nPosition Sleep Efficiency as a Driver for Wellness\nEmphasize in marketing campaigns how sleep efficiency is a differentiated feature that allows users to improve their quality of sleep and therefore their general well-being.\n\nActivity-Sleep Challenges\nEngage in targeted activity-sleep challenge campaigns. These may take the form of challenging users to reach step goals with the aim of improving sleep efficiency. Users are rewarded through insights or incentives.\n\nCustomer Education Campaigns\nCreate content that will empower the user in developing a deeper understanding of how sleep efficiency and activity level are related to one another, thus enabling them to optimize both for better health outcomes.","metadata":{}}]}
